# tmgmt-zanata-dev-env

Scripts to help set up the development environment to work on tmgmt-zanata.

This is targeted for my personal use, so it is not tested extensively with
different use-cases or on different platforms. It will probably work on
Fedora 20, and maybe on other platforms, but don't count on it.
